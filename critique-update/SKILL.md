# Critique Update

## Review Posture

Lead with the highest-impact issues. Be direct. Do not compliment filler. If the draft is generic, say exactly where and why.

## Checklist

Evaluate the draft on:

- Generic swap test: could a competitor publish this unchanged?
- Missing why: does it explain why this was built beyond user demand?
- No opinion: does it make a claim anyone could disagree with?
- No tradeoffs: does it hide the choices that would make the story credible?
- Feature-first opening: does it start with product inventory instead of problem, shift, or belief?
- Weak proof: does it claim value without showing workflow, data, quote, or before/after?
- AI gloss: does it sound polished but information-poor?
- Voice mismatch: does it sound like the company or like a generic launch template?
- Unsupported claim: does it imply outcomes the evidence does not prove?

## Scoring

Score 1-10 across:

- Angle
- Specificity
- Proof
- Credibility
- Voice
- Usefulness

Do not average into a fake precise score unless useful. A short scorecard is enough.

## Workflow

1. Read the full draft and any supporting context.
2. Identify the 3-5 highest-impact issues.
3. Recommend the angle the rewrite should use.
4. Rewrite the weak sections or the full draft, depending on user request.
5. List missing private context that would make the draft materially stronger.
